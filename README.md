# apollo-graphql-server
Boilerplate server using apollo, graphql, and mongodb.

## Getting started
Quick instruction for getting the server up and running:
1. Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create a new database.
2. Create a .env file with variables PORT and MONGO_URI specified.
3. To start the server, run the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
After these steps, you should have a fully functioning and seeded database.

## Use
Use the [Graphql playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/graphql-playground.html) to test your database. It can be accessed through *localhost:YOUR_PORT/graphql*.
